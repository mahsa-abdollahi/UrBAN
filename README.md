# UrBAN-Urban-Beehive-Acoustics-and-PheNotyping-Dataset

This repository contains scripts for analyzing the UrBAN dataset. This multimodal dataset obtained from a honey bee colony in Montréal, Quebec, Canada, spanning the years of 2021 to 2022. This apiary comprised 10 beehives, with microphones recording more than 2000 hours of high quality raw audio, and also sensors capturing temperature, and humidity. Periodic hive inspections involved monitoring colony honey bee population changes, assessing queen-related conditions, and documenting overall hive health.

## Applications

There are two notebooks in this repository. 

1. [main_benchmarks.ipynb](code/main_benchmarks.ipynb)
2. [data_description_plots_2021_2022.ipynb](code/data_description_plots_2021_2022.ipynb)


Details and code related to how feture extraction and regression could be used on the audio dataset is described in [main_benchmarks.ipynb](code/main_benchmarks.ipynb), while [data_description_plots_2021_2022.ipynb](code/data_description_plots_2021_2022.ipynb) contains codes related to how to visualize the datsets.
